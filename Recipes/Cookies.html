        <H1>Cookies that will make you believe in God</H1>
        <p class="background"></p>
            
        <p>The cookies are a spin off of the cookie recipe from 'Sally's Baking Addiction'
            which is probably a spin off from some other website... which is probably a
            spin off from a cook book. Because how different can chocolate chip cookie recipes 
            really be?
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3 class="tangent">Tangent</h3>
        <p>This is where I list all of the cookie ingredients, some of which you will purchase
            just for this recipes and then never use again. They will sit in your pantry wondering
            to themselves 'Oh, when will I ever be used? Why does my master continue to choose to 
            buy premade cookies from the store when they could simply spend 3 hours making Cookies
            at home and then posting them on Instagram so that they can feel as if they did something
            with their night even though really all they did was something that their ancesters would
            do every day just to survive...' but I digress:

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3 class = "tangent">Tangent</h3>
        <p>Here is where I tell you what to do to turn those gross looking ingredients 
            into something amazing. You know, back in the day people would get called wizards
            and witches for doing something like this. Actually, while we are on the topic
            why are wizards displayed as these powerful badasses who everyone wants to hang out
            with, but witches are ulgy old ladies who are burned to death? Like you got Gandalf,
            Harry Potter, Merlin... and then you got Broomhilda and the women who get burned in 
            the crucible. Talk about double standards....

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. 
                    Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar 
                    together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. 
                    Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into 
                    dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. 
                    The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips. 
                    The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, 
                    but do your best to combine them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours 
                    or up to 3 days. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight 
                    for less spreading.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften 
                    at room temperature for 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment 
                    paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant 
                    Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for XL cookies or 2 
                    heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium/large 
                    cookies. Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather than 
                    wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. 
                    Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8-9 balls of dough onto each 
                    cookie sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake the cookies for 12-13 minutes or until the edges are very 
                    lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.) 
                    The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue 
                    to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. 
                    Meanwhile, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of 
                    the warm cookies. This is optional and only for looks. After 10 
                    minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire 
                    rack to cool completely. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
                </li>
