This project is to create a website with recipes using what I have learned so far in Odin.
I will create an Index page, which will act as my home page. 
In the Index page, I will have an Appatizer, Main Course, and Dessert section.
These sections will be broken out in an unordered list.
Each section will have a link to another page that provides a recipe for the meal.
